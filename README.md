**DFON** :: **D**efinition **F**ormat **O**bject **N**otation to **JSON** along with code for generating code in other selected programming languages.
 
## Type Specification Language
 
This is a line delimited language or secifying abstract data types.
 
This language is limited in scope. This language only concerns itself with static type definition. It does not utilize any means of specifying operational language. Instead, it generates notation that may be use to direct language generation tools to include code for type checking in either compilation phases or runtime phases.

This language does not use white space to define scope. It uses character delimiters found in popuplar block style languages.


### _Type Specification Block_

Each type being specified is allocated a block of description.

Each block starts with peculiar syntax. The end of a block is found at the place the next block begins or at the end of file.
